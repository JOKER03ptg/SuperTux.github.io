### SuperTux on Mobile Platforms

Right now, there is no official support for mobile platforms (e.g. Android,
iOS). However, there are community-provided ports for some of these platforms.
**Since we do not own or control these, use of them is at your own discretion.**
Also, it might be possible that these ports are out of date or have a limited
set of features.

- Android: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lethargik.supertux2&hl=en) [Source Code](https://github.com/pelya/supertux)

### SuperTux Development Versions (unstable)

Every change made to the main SuperTux development tree is compiled
automatically and then packaged on all major platforms, namely Linux, Windows,
and macOS. This allows us to provide builds of the most recent changes to
SuperTux for everyone.

You can find download links for these builds on our [Nightly download
page](https://download.supertux.org/).
