To show our appreciation to [donors](/donate), we've been sending out two gift
packages since last Christmas. Since we plan on making more of such gift
packages in the future, we decided it was a good idea to keep everyone
up-to-date about what's in there.

However, in order to enjoy this extra content, usually provided in the form of
an add-on and appropriate installation instructions for the operating systems we
support, you will need to [donate](/donate) (via PayPal, since we can't know
your email address when you're donating Bitcoins). Donations help us finance
project-related infrastructure, paying developers or artists, and sending
developers to conferences or similar. All donors get access to current, past,
and future gift packages.

The current gift package contains the level "Crystal Mine" by RustyBox. It's the
first official level to use the crystal cave tiles and supposed to connect Icy
Island with Forest Island in a future release of SuperTux.
In addition, it features various other unique elements.
